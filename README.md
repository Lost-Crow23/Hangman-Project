# Hangman 

## Description 

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Aim and Conclusion

The aim of this project is to implement a simple game so that the user can play whilst implementing a new feature into the classic game. 

The key factors that was to be established in this hangman project is:
 - The proper use of OOP and understanding how it's important to structure thus learning the key terms of how to use them.
 - Use different methods and functions to illustrate basic skills of python
 -  Ability to abstract and encapsulate the given conditions and rules 

### What I learned
The basics of using such powerful tools like the use of the `import` keyword which address's a particular module and is very vital for structering your code. Implementing the `D.R.Y` factor. 

Using the `while` and `if` loops to structure a boolean value within my code is essential to deliver a game with an `input`(function) and is the key to control flow to achieve such a simple but assertive game.

### Improvements

- Coding a feature visualisation image to track the amount of wrong input guesses such as when you play it tradionally.
- Adding a module, which inputs a dictionary that rather having a limited number of words, it will be alot more. 

### Installation Instruction 

1. Fork the python file onto your own github repo 
2. `Git clone` onto your local IDE onto your chosen path
3. Once opened, browse the folder and open...
4. You have to run the file within the script by using the provided function in the script `if name = main`. 
5. Once ran, you may play the game. 

### Usage Instruction

- Requirements 
  - Python 3.x
  - VScode, IDE or google colab

This is an `object orientated programming(OOP)` version of the classic game of hangman which illustrates the use of class, objects and methods then finally calling the class as a variable under the `play game` define function. The file constructs of `importing random` then passing `hangman` as a class and it's attributes thus passing on methods(rules) for the backbone of when the game is played.

`hangman template` 
- The ideal psuedocode of the bases of implementing the logic behind the hangman game

`milestone_2` 
- Sample of the basic use of `random.choice`

`milestone_3`
- Implementing the practice logic of simple functions later to be used

`milestone_4`

- The class and it's methods to develop the hangman game 

`milestone_5`

- Final Step of the hangman defining the `play_game` function 

This is a `.py` (python) file
