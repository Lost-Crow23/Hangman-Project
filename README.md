Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The aim of this project is to implement a simple game so that the user can play whilst implementing a new feature into the classic game. 

What I learned is the basics of using such powerful tools like the use of the `import` keyword which address's a particular module and is very vital for structering your code and implementing the D.R.Y factor. 

Using the `while`, `if` and `loops` to structure a boolean value within my code is essential to deliver a game with an `input`(function) to engage the player with rules. 

### Installation Instruction 

- Download the zip file onto your local IDE. 
- Once opened, browse the folder and open...

### Usage Instruction

### File Structure 

##### Python files

These are files ending with .py which is initialised in an IDE such like VScode, so the file runs as a python file. I have illustrated simple define functions for the game in steps so that it is easy to navigate and follow.
