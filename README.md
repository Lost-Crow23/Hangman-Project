## Aim and Conclusion

The aim of this project is to implement a simple game so that the user can play whilst implementing a new feature into the classic game. 

What I learned is the basics of using such powerful tools like the use of the import keyword which address's a particular module and is very vital for structering your code and implementing the D.R.Y factor. 

Using the while and if loops to structure a boolean value within my code is essential to deliver a game with an input(function)

### Installation Instruction 

- Download the zip file onto your local IDE. 
- Once opened, browse the folder and open...

### Usage Instruction

### File Structure 

This is an `object orientated programming(OOP)` version of the classic game of hangman which illustrates the use of class, objects and methods then finally calling the class as a variable under the `play game` define function. The file constructs of `importing random` then passing `hangman` as a class and it's attributes thus passing on methods(rules) for the backbone of when the game is played.

This is a `.py` (python) file
