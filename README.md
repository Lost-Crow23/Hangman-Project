# Hangman 

## Table of contents

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The aim of this project is to implement a simple game so that the user can play whilst implementing a new feature into the classic game.
